# 🤖 LLM-Powered Multi-Task Chatbot with FLAN-T5 & DistilBERT | Flask App

This project showcases a production-ready **NLP chatbot** built using **FLAN-T5** and **DistilBERT** that performs three powerful language tasks:

🔹 **Sentiment Analysis**  
🔹 **Text Summarization**  
🔹 **Question Answering**

All tasks are served through a **Flask API**, demonstrating how to build and deploy large language model (LLM) applications.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Uses **FLAN-T5** (Google's instruction-tuned encoder-decoder LLM) for:
  - Abstractive summarization
  - Question answering from context
- ✅ Uses **DistilBERT** (a distilled version of BERT) for sentiment classification
- ✅ End-to-end **Flask web app** that integrates all tasks via a unified API
- ✅ Demonstrates **prompt-based inference**, pipeline orchestration, and deployment logic
- ✅ Plug-and-play modular design for real-world NLP apps
